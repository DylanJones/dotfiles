# Dylan's config files
This is a repository that has most of my normal setup.  I made sure that most of it doesn't require root privelages to install.
The script will install Powerline, `oh-my-zsh`, my custom Powerline modules, a few vim plugins, and more.
The file `install.sh` should remove any existing conflicting configuration and replace it with this one.  It should work on any Debian, Raspbian, Ubuntu, or Arch Linux system.
