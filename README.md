# Dylan's config files

This repository kind of, sort of contains my normal configs.  There's a bunch of stuff missing, but this does cover the gist of it.


Take a look at install.sh for an idea of what packages you'll need to install and what symlinks to make, but don't expect it to actually work if you try to run it.
